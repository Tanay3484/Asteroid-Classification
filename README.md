# Asteroid Classification

This project was created by Tanay Singh, SRN : PES2UG20CS364.

The project uses the "Near Earth Objects" (NEO) dataset provided by NASA in order to find out which is the best model to classify a newly found NEO under the class of either "Hazardous" to humanity or "Safe".

To run this project file, make sure a python notebook environment in Anaconda is set up (Jupyter notebook).

The following are the module dependencies needed for the proper running of the project : 
- Pandas 
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matploltlib
- Imblearn
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow


These libraries can be downloaded using the following commands : 
- Pandas : pip install pandas
- Numpy : pip install numpy
- Seaborn : pip install seaborn
- Matplotlib : pip install matplotlib
- Imblearn : pip install imbalanced-learn
- Sklearn : pip install scikit-learn
- Tensorflow : pip install tensorflow


Post downloading these libraries, download the dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification

Make sure that the csv file and the ipynb files are in the same working directory, otherwise python will not be able to read the csv file unless the full path to the file is mentioned.

Once the above mentioned libraries and the dataset has been downloaded, simply run all the cells of the notebook using the "Run all" option in Jupyter notebook to see the results of the project.
